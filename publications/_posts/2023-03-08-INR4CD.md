title: Implicit neural representation for change detection
description: >
    Unsupervised urban sprawling change detection with implicit neural representation with a two step method. Shape reconstruction for support correction followed by simple difference of the two shapes leading to the detected change. The findings of the paper are: 1) this method beats state of the art and is close to the supervised schemes, 2) an agreement loss term allows to reconciliate and utilises both timestamped point clouds raw information.
