I was a teaching assistant for the segmentation practical sessions for the course *Deep Learning For Image Analysis* given in the ATHENS Programme by Etienne Decenci√®re, Santiago Velasco-Forero and Thomas Walter. I animated a practical session on tissue segmentation, the notebook and presentation can be found in [github](https://github.com/ThomasWalter/DeepLearningForImageAnalysis) and the data can be found [here](/data/).
