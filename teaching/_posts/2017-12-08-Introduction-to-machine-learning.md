You can find all the desired information on the lecturer git hub page: [Chloe-Agathe Azencott](https://github.com/chagaz/ma2823_2017).
I gave a 1h30 research talk with [Joseph Boyd](https://jcboyd.github.io/). This course was given in Central Supelec.
The material related to the research talk for my part can be found [here](https://cloud.mines-paristech.fr/index.php/s/gLPbwM6vBV3NYiW).
