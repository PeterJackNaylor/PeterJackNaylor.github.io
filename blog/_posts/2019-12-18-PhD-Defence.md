I defended my PhD on the 18<sup>th</sup> of December 2019 at 2 pm in amphitheater Lacassagne, [slides](http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~pnaylor/Downloads/PNaylor_defence.pdf) and [manuscript](http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~pnaylor/Downloads/PhD_PeterNaylor.pdf).

My PhD is entitled: *From cellular phenotypes to the analysis of whole slide images: Application to treatment response in triple-negative breast cancer* supervised by Thomas Walter and here is the first introductory slide discussing the title:
