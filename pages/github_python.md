   Here is a non exhausted list of informatics projects I have contributed to:
---
- [ScaleDependentCNN](https://github.com/PeterJackNaylor/ScaleDependentCNN), Scale Dependent Convolutional layer for feature extraction of nuclei in histopathology data. The code for the pipeline is written in Nextflow and the processes use python.
- [Galore](https://github.com/hclimente/galore), Graphical models applied to gene-expression data. Main author is [Hector Climente-Gonzalez](https://hclimente.eu/) (on going).
- [Knockoff-MMD-HSIC](https://github.com/PeterJackNaylor/knockoff-MMD-HSIC), python package and reproducible code linked to a submitted paper. Code co-developed with [Hector Climente-Gonzalez](https://hclimente.eu/) (01/11/2021)
- [NucSeg](https://github.com/PeterJackNaylor/NucSeg): Nextflow pipeline to train a nuclei segmentation network with all available nuclei segmentation datasets (at the time) with model such as ResNet on steroids and so on. (01/09/2021)
- [The dart Application](https://github.com/PeterJackNaylor/dart-app) which is a flask/dash website for custom dart games hosted on our family Raspberry Pi. Project developed with Bruno Naylor (26/06/2021).
- [PhD_template](https://github.com/PeterJackNaylor/my_phd_template): Template used for my dissertation (17/12/2019).
- [Cellular heatmap generation and classification](https://github.com/PeterJackNaylor/CellularHeatmaps): A project based on the segmentation of nuclei in histology images, from the segmentation we extract a certain number of features, perform an unsupervised dimension reduction on the nuclei sets, transform this extraction to the tissue in order to generate cellular heatmaps, and finally a supervised model for the classification of these heatmaps (12/11/2019) (on going).
- [AutomaticWSI](https://github.com/PeterJackNaylor/AutomaticWSI): The prediction of residual cancer burden from histological TNBC biopsy sections prior to treatment, the code contains a full pipeline to analyze Whole Slide Images automatically (8/12/2019) (on going).
- [BestNucleiModel](https://github.com/PeterJackNaylor/BestNucleiModel): A nested-cross validation distributed with Nextflow to assess the best nuclei segmentation model  (10/12/2018).
- [segmentation_net package](https://github.com/PeterJackNaylor/segmentation_net): Python code based on Tensorflow for segmentation tasks (not available yet).
- [dynamic_watershed package](https://github.com/PeterJackNaylor/dynamic_watershed): Python package implementing the algorithm for splitting nuclei described in in 'Nuclei segmentation in histopathology images using deep neural networks' (27/08/2018).
- [useful_wsi package](https://github.com/PeterJackNaylor/useful_wsi): Python code implementing a set of useful tools to deal with Whole Slide Image (WSI) formats (14/07/2018).
- [Segmentation of Nuclei in Histopathology Images by deep regression of the distance map](https://github.com/PeterJackNaylor/DRFNS):  This Github repository contains the necessary code to reproduce the work contained in the submitted paper (cf. link name) (24/04/2018).
